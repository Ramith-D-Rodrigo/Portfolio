        description: `Implemented a new feature to run tests of a Ballerina project in Docker containers. Created Uber (Fat) JARs to bundle the test execution dependencies.
        Leveraged the power of dynamic class loading to support function mocking inside the containers. Added support for GraalVM execution and wrote relevant unit and integration tests using TestNG.
        Completed the project 2 months ahead of schedule. Then experimented and found possible solutions related to an issue in Ballerina resource loading in tests.`,
